* Process Overview
** Data Sources
*** FULL Data
**** Stored Procedure: SP_PBI_DCC_ITALY_H
**** Tables and Logic:
***** `PBI_DCC_H_cache`
***** Event Handling: IDV, ELV, IPC, ERY, ICO, ECY
**** Output: `PBI_DCC_H_cache` (Finalized FULL data)
*** EMPTY Data
**** Stored Procedure: SP_PBI_Equipment_Event_Empty
**** Event Types: MST, MRY, MSH, MCY
**** Stored Procedure: SP_PBI_DCC_ITALY_H_EM
**** Tables and Logic:
***** `PBI_DCC_H_EM_cache`
**** Output: `PBI_DCC_H_EM_cache` (Finalized EMPTY data)
** Data Combination
*** Final Merge
**** Table: `PBI_DCC_H_ALL_cache`
**** Combines FULL (`PBI_DCC_H_cache`) and EMPTY (`PBI_DCC_H_EM_cache`) data
**** Logic:
***** UNION ALL of FULL and EMPTY
***** Adjustments for BusinessEntityGroup and calculated fields (e.g., `DWell_Time`)
** Key Calculations
*** DWell Time
**** Derived from event date differences (PORT, RAIL, TRUCK)
**** Handles null or default values
*** Event Type
**** Derived from event columns: Event_Port, Event_Transport_Rail, Event_Transport_Truck
** Outputs
*** `PBI_DCC_H_ALL_cache`
**** Comprehensive container event data for FULL and EMPTY containers
